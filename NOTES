 - Ensure that the ground connection between the comparator circuit and the
   'power' ground going into the reverse polarity FET is made directly to the
   sense resistor. This is to prevent any voltage drop between the sense
   resistor and the reverse polairty protection FET from affecting the current
   limit.
